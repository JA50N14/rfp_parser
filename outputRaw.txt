Limitations
•
Lost Wages calculation is not supported as part of the Lost Time periods table on the DMF.
 
•
“Chart Notes” functionality, where multiple sub
-
records can be added, is available in the application but not supported in PDF o
utput.
 
To 
capture in both the application and in PDF output, specific text fields can be utilized on the DMF for notes.
•
Time period details for Modified Duties and Lost Time periods are not available in PDF output. Total Modified Duties days and
 
to
tal Lost Time 
days are available in PDF output.
•
On the MWO, for the Duties list, a separate comment field for each value is not available assuming each Duty is a list value 
for
 
an overall 
attribute of approved Duties.
 
A single comment field for Duties overall, or a group of Duties could be utilized, but this comme
nt field would 
not be directly connected to the selected values inside the system.
•
Given the volume of data fields and form logic desired, it will be important to consider the implications this may have on th
e f
orm's 
performance to maximize user experience. Every consideration should be made to formulate a design for the form(s) that minimi
zes
 
the 
amount of processing that needs to be performed each time the form is opened and/or saved. This may require streamlining form 

dy
namics.
Assumptions
•
The MWO would be created after the DMF data that feeds the MWO is finalized/locked down to prevent MWO data from becoming out
 
of
 
date after generation of the MWO.
 
Or,
 
the business approach would be to generate a new MWO if any DMF data changes. It is assumed 
multiple MWO’s may be needed for a single DMF to support the case where an MWO is not approved and/or supporting data needs t
o b
e 
changed.
•
The fields under the “Allowed LT section” are assumed to be manually entered data.
 
Simple summation of a ~6 fields into one fie
ld is 
supported.
